# website-with-bootstrap

This is a School Project that I decided to make about my art. 
So I planed to make a website where i can show my art creations. I want to make clean and simple looking site because I enjoy minimalistic looks.

In this project I'am supposed to use Bootstrap, Sass, JavaScript and some new Css techniques. 
I will make a page that is only for the teatchers about my JavaScript skills that I have lerned in the past weeks.
